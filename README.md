# Credit-Risk-Default-Model

## Introduction
The **Credit Risk Default Model** is a Python-based machine learning project aimed at predicting the probability that a borrower will default on a loan. This project utilizes various predictive models to analyze a borrower's credit history, evaluate risk, and provide insights into the potential default risks.

## Motivation
This project was developed to assist financial institutions in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals. By accurately predicting credit risk, lenders can minimize losses associated with defaults while providing fair opportunities to potential borrowers. The model's predictions can help tailor the terms of loans such as interest rates based on individual risk profiles.
